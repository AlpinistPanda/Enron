# Identifying Fraud From Enron Dataset

## Overview

Enron Scandal is one of the biggest financial scandals happened in the US which surfaced in 2001. It involves staff of executives that - by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting â€“ were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal. It eventually led to the bankruptcy of Enron corporation and 40$ billion lawsuit by shareholders. In this project we will use machine learning methods on a dataset coming from Enron from the time this scandal happened to find out who was involved in this fraud.

## Instructions

I did this project using Ipython of Jupyter notebook, so all the visuals and narrative is in that document. Here I only give a brief instruction on how to work the Python file.

Since I used Ipython my file is very linear and messy I didnt want to spend time on correcting that file which is _poi_id.py_ . I used Anaconda virtual environment with Python 3, I corrected print statements so that I can work in Python 3. So to work on these file grader needs either Python 3 environment or needs to get rid of the parentheses from the print statements. 

The jupyter notbebook file is enron.ipynb.
